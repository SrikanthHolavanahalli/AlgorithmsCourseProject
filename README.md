This Project was a part of Algorithms Design and Analysis course (B503) in Indiana University Bloomington (IUB).

Designed and implemented an algorithm to get all the consistent sub-DAG's of a DAG and applied it to Gene Ontology. The definition of a consistent sub-graph is that all the vertices present in it, should also have all of their parent vertices present (parent vertices in the original DAG given) and all the edges connecting these vertices. The algorithm was also implemented on Tree's.
